# Lessons — Application Tracker

Curated operational lessons from real usage. The `meta.yaml` schema itself lives in SKILL.md.

Last reviewed: 2026-07-19

Lifecycle tags: each `##` section carries `<!-- added: <first-seen> · last_confirmed: <date> · status: active -->`
(gardener `lessons_report` parses these; `added` = the section's first git appearance, `last_confirmed` = last review date).

## Status Management
<!-- added: 2026-04-16 · last_confirmed: 2026-07-19 · status: active -->
- Each `jobs:` entry has a per-job `status` (`drafted` / `applied` / `in_progress` / `rejected` /
  `ignored`); the folder is the DERIVED overall status, rolled up by precedence
  `in_progress > applied > drafted > rejected > ignored`. Change status only on explicit request —
  `status.py --update <slug> <status>` (whole app: stamps every job + moves the folder) or
  `--update-job <slug> <role-match> <status>` (one posting: recomputes the rollup + moves if it
  changed). A hand-moved folder must be re-synced via `--update`, else `--check-metadata` flags the
  folder↔rollup mismatch. Move promptly (a stale folder makes pipeline reviews useless).

## Metadata
<!-- added: 2026-04-16 · last_confirmed: 2026-07-19 · status: active -->
- Always record `channel` (referral/cold/recruiter/linkedin) — it predicts conversion rates;
  `next_action` with a date keeps momentum (review weekly).
- Job facts are per posting and live inside each `jobs:` entry: `job_level` (incl. approximate
  float-bounded Google equivalent), `required_yoe`, and `salary_range` — schema **v4** (per-job
  `status`; no `total_compensation_range`). Live JD values win; the dated, sourced company-level cache
  (`config.company_levels_path()`, its own schema-v2 file — the company-levels cache format, a
  different file from `meta.yaml`, whose only supported schema is v4) is level/YOE fallback only.
- Never round-trip application `meta.yaml` through `safe_dump`. Use the node-anchored metadata
  editor/backfill so comments, quoting, blank lines, and CRLF survive; multi-role enrichment
  requires an exact `jd_file` for each job.

## Process
<!-- added: 2026-04-16 · last_confirmed: 2026-07-19 · status: active -->
- Referrals convert significantly better than cold applications — track and optimize for this.
- Follow up ~1 week after applying if no response; save recruiter contact info early (needed
  at the negotiation stage).

## Layout & application log
<!-- added: 2026-04-16 · last_confirmed: 2026-07-19 · status: active -->
- Each folder keeps only the final PDFs, the bundled `..._Application_<job title>.txt`,
  `meta.yaml`, and optional `notes.md` at its root; JD files (`source/JD-<job title>.md`),
  `tailored.yaml`, and the DOCX live in `source/`. `status.py`'s files column shows
  `docx+pdf+cl+txt` (txt = the bundled application file).
- `<profile-dir>/applications-log.yaml` (`<applications_root>/0_profile/`) is regenerated from
  all folders with `status.py --sync-log`; re-run it after adding or moving applications so
  job-search skips already-considered postings. The canonical
  `.agents/skills/job-search/companies.yaml` registry carries the blacklist (`blacklist:`
  reason per entry) of employers job-search should never surface.
